# Car Plate Detector and Reading Plate Number

## Introduction
*In a modern world with images all around. It's a new challenge to read text from images. One realtime problem could be detecting and reading car plate numbers.*

## Problem Statement:
Aim is to detect car plate numbers from images. After detecting images extract the car plate number.

## Data: 
Data was collected from Kaggle, linked it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection).
This dataset contains 433 images with bounding box annotations of the car license plates within the image.
Annotations are provided in the PASCAL VOC format.
